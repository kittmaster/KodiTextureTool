Zero registry writes. Zero fuss.

### 🪟 Platform Compatibility

This tool is designed **exclusively for Windows 7/10/11**.  
Due to deep integration with Windows-specific APIs, GUI frameworks (PySide6), and runtime dependencies, cross-platform support is not feasible.  

Attempts to run on macOS or Linux — including via Wine or emulation — are **unsupported** and may result in unpredictable behavior or failure to launch.  

Developers are welcome to explore the source code, but official support remains **Windows-only by design**.

---

### 🌍 Translations

Currently supports **U.S. English only**.  
Multi-language support is on the roadmap. Stay tuned!

---

### 🏆 Credits

A modernized continuation of SUUP’s original work.  
Proudly updated for compatibility with **Windows 10/11** platforms.
